# AWWW
Awww Web Workshop Workstation

A workstation management system using PHP and SQL, currently only in Polish.

It was intended to be a clone of moodle - but when I first started making it, I didn't consider actually using moodle instead of reinventing the wheel. 
It was used by [Junior GameDev Academy](https://gamedev.skni.umcs.pl/) for a few months and it proved that this tool works.

## Setup

Edit ini files in awww_engine (TODO: install script)
